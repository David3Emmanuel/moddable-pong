## Contributing

This repo is being developed internally based on the needs and active pilots of the Endless learning team. Endless team members should **communicate openly with the team to avoid potential merge conflicts**, as we are still learning best practices for collaborative development of a Godot project.

External contributions are welcome, but may be difficult to integrate during periods of more rapid development; **communicating with the Endless team via filing an issue against this repo is highly encouraged** before sinking too much time into a PR.
